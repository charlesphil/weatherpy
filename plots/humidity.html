My initial assumption is that it has to do with it being winter, though I would not be able to know for sure unless I test for it. The more northern a city, the more likely it is that it will be snowing/precipitating, and therefore have higher humidity. However, I would also have expected northern cities in the winter to be colder, and therefore drier, so seeing these results is very unexpected.</p>

Although the relationship is weak, my initial guess as to why there might be a correlation between southern city latitude and the lower humidity is because of drier weather due to the southern hemisphere's summer season. Whether the season itself is causing this is a question that should be experimentally tested.</p>
