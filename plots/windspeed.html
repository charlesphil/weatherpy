Even when we separate between northern and southern cities, we see very similar results. What is different between the two halves, however, is that the range of wind speeds in northern cities is much wider, ranging from 0 to 35 mph as opposed to 0 to 25 in the south. Much like cloudiness, wind speed is extremely dependent on atmospheric variables, as opposed to global positions. It would be better to look at wind speed over a period of time to account for the day-to-day differences in wind speed. My initial assumption, however, is that we are unlikely to see any relationship come about from doing so.</p>
