                    <p class="card-text">We see a very weak, positive correlation between northern cities and their cloudiness percentage. However, the only reason why there may be any correlation at all with regards to this dataset is because of how the points are clustered on the plot. There are two large clusters, where about half of the points seem to lie around 80 to 100% cloudiness and the other half lying somewhere around 0 to 40%. It seems that the closer to the equator a city is, the less cloudy it is, and vice versa.

                    <p class="card-text">Similar to the northern cities, there seems to be an enormous cluster of cities with around 100% cloudiness, and their latitudes range from -40 to 0 degrees. Because of that large range, I am more inclined to think that there is very little correlation between a city's latitude and their cloudiness. I suspect that this apparent positive relationship has more to do with the fact that the cluster is skewing the regression line towards it. Thinking about it further, cloud formation is more dependent on transitory physical causes that can occur anywhere on earth, so I would expect very little correlation here with latitude.</p>
